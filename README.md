# PULASki
Official code of the paper "PULASki: Learning inter-rater variability using statistical distances to improve probabilistic segmentation", that started as an extension to the work (mainly code) "DS6, Deformation-aware Semi-supervised Learning: Application to Small Vessel Segmentation with Noisy Training Data" (https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.10802)

This branch has been moved to its own repo: https://github.com/soumickmj/PULASki

This branch thus won't be maintained anymore. All future updates will be pushed to the PULASki repo.
